# This is a fork
This is a fork of [wikimedia/wikipedia-ios](https://github.com/wikimedia/wikipedia-ios). Its only purpose is to have non-master branches for submitting pull-requests. In order to make that clear and to avoid using this repo's `master` branch by accident, this repo does not have a `master` branch; instead it has this default `_master` branch with only this information.
